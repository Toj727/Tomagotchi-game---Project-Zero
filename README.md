<strong>Don't Kill The Cat!</strong>

Don't Kill The Cat! is a tamagotchi digital pet game. The goal of the game is to keep your cat alive by feeding it, petting it, and letting it sleep. If any of its boredom, sleepiness, or hunger levels reach 10, your cat dies and you lose the game.

I used HTML, CSS, Jquery, and JavaScript to create the game. While creating the game I had a lot of failures that culminated in a final triumph of the game being functional. 

Some unsolved problems I have in my game are: 

    The variables will go into the negatives if the buttons are pushed enough. 

    There is no way for the game to end unless the cat dies. 

    There is also no way to reset the game without refreshing the games.

User Story

    1. The user starts the game by entering in a name in the start game input field.

    2. The game begins and the user's chosen name appears next to the pet image.

    3. The user can keep the cat alive by utilizing the three buttons at the bottom of the page to keep the scores from reaching 10. Feed, pet, and lights. 

        The feed button decreases the hunger score.

        The pet button decreases the boredom score.

        The lights buttons decreases the sleepiness score. 

    4. As the cat reaches age 3 and then 6, the image will change to reflect the age change.

    5. If the user does not keep the scores under 10, the cat will die and a screen will appear and say "Your Cat Has Died."
